      <h2>What happens next</h2>
      <p>Researchers will contact you if they think you may be suitable for their coronavirus health research. Researchers may be from the NHS, or other places like drug companies or universities.</p>
      <p>There is no guarantee you'll be contacted to be part of health research. If you are not contacted, this will be because researchers already have the mix of people they need.</p>
      <p>If a researcher asks you to take part in their research, you do not have to say yes. It's your choice.</p>
      
      <h3>Contact from NHS Digital</h3>
