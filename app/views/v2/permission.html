          <p>A clinical trial compares one medicine or treatment with another. People who work on clinical trials are called researchers.</p>

        <p>I understand:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a researcher will only contact me if I appear eligible for a clinical trial</li>
          <li>researchers may find I am not eligible after they have contacted me for a trial</li>
          <li>any of my data that researchers use will be kept secure and confidential</li>
          <li>I can withdraw my permission to be contacted by researchers at any time. I can find out how to do this in the email Iâ€™ll receive when I give my permission here. I can still take part in trials I am currently involved in, but will no longer be contacted for any future clinical trials</li>
          <li>I can find out more about taking part in clinical trials at the <a target=blank href="https://www.bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/">Be a part of research</a> website (opens in a new window)</li>
