      <p>Vaccine studies are the only way to find effective vaccines. Thank you for helping the NHS to save lives.</p>

      <p>We've sent you a confirmation email from <strong>contact-for.research@nhs.net</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What happens next</h2>
      <p>You will get an email if researchers think you may be suitable for their coronavirus vaccine studies. The email may come directly from researchers, or from NHS Digital.</p>

      <p>In England, the research partner of the NHS is the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The NIHR is working with equivalent NHS research partners in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales on vaccine studies. If you sign up to be contacted about vaccine studies, only researchers on studies approved by NIHR will be able to contact you.</p>

      <img src="/images/nihr-logo.png" class="app-nihr-logo" alt="" >

      <p>You can find out more information about the vaccine studies on NIHR's <a href="https://www.bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/vaccine-studies/">Be Part of Research website</a>.</p>

        <p>There is no guarantee you'll be contacted to be part of vaccine studies. If you are not contacted, this will be because researchers already have the mix of people they need.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>If a researcher asks you to take part in their study, you do not have to say yes. It's your choice.</p>
      
      <h3>Contact from NHS Digital</h3>
