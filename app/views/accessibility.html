      <p>This accessibility statement applies to the sign up to be contacted for coronavirus vaccine studies service (<a href='/{{ version }}''>https://www.nhs.uk/sign-up-to-be-contacted-for-research</a>) which is run by NHS Digital.</p>

      <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you should be able to:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
          <li>Zoom in up to 400 per cent without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
          <li>Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
          <li>Interact with most of the website using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also try to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
      <p>If you have a disability, <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use</a>.</p>

      <h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
      <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The search bar component has insufficient colour contrast</li>
          <li>Content written in Welsh has not been programmatically defined as Welsh</li>
          <li>Some versions of VoiceOver on iOS do not tell you if the details component (help text) has expanded or not</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We link to websites we do not own or manage and cannot guarantee their accessibility.</p>

      <h2>Feedback and contact information</h2>

      <p>We are always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. <a href='https://www.nhs.uk/contact-us/nhs-website-contact-us'>Contact us</a> if you have an accessibility query including:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Issues with accessing information or using this website</li>
          <li>An accessibility problem not listed on this statement</li>
          <li>Any positive feedback about this websiteâ€™s accessibility</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This service has been developed to meet the needs of the on-going research into coronavirus vaccines, which is happening at pace and with multiple teams across the country.</p>

      <p>This digital solution has been put in place to:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>recruit large numbers of people quickly for coronavirus vaccine studies</li>
          <li>reduce the burden on GP practices to identify potential participants</li>
      </ul>

      <p>People who do not use the digital service will still be able to take part in coronavirus research as they will continue to be approached in clinical settings. This service allows a wide range of participants to be involved in research who may otherwise be unable to sign-up due to limited interaction with the health service.</p>

      <p>The non-digital recruitment of individuals to trials will continue alongside this service in a complementary manner. We are not linking the services as the non-digital service is more driven by clinicians in clinical settings than the general public contacting clinicians.</p>
