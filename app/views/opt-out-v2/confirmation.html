      <p>You will no longer be contacted by any researchers about future coronavirus vaccine studies.</p>
      <p>If your details have already been shared with researchers, we'll tell them to take you off their list. This may take 28 days. If a researcher contacts you within this time, you can tell them that you have withdrawn your permission.</p>
      <p>This does not remove you from any trials you are currently taking part in.</p>
      <p>NHS Digital will no longer contact you about any coronavirus prevention and treatment research, or any other health research.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Giving your permission again</h2>
      <p>If you change your mind, you can <a href="/v5">give your permission again to be contacted for taking part in coronavirus vaccine studies</a>.</p>
