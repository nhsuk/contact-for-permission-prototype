  <p>Dear Joe Bloggs,</p>

  <p>Thank you. You've given your permission to be contacted about taking part in coronavirus vaccine research</p>

  <p>Health research is the only way to find effective treatments and vaccines. Thank you for helping the NHS to save lives.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>What happens next</h2>
  <p>Researchers will contact you if they think you may be suitable for their coronavirus health research. Researchers may be from the NHS, or other places like drug companies or universities.</p>
  <p>There is no guarantee you'll be contacted to be part of health research. If you are not contacted, this will be because researchers already have the mix of people they need.</p>
  <p>If a researcher asks you to take part in their research, you do not have to say yes. It's your choice.</p>
  
  <h3>Contact from NHS Digital</h3>
  <p>If you agreed to NHS Digital contacting you about developments to this service to provide opportunities to take part in health research, they'll contact you when there's new information to share.</p>
