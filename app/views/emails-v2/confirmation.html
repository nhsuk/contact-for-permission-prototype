  <p>Dear Joe Bloggs,</p>

  <p>Thank you. You've given your permission to be contacted about taking part in coronavirus vaccine research</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>What happens next</h2>
  <p>Researchers will contact you if they think you may be suitable for their coronavirus health research. Researchers may be from the NHS, or other places like drug companies or universities.</p>
  <p>There is no guarantee you'll be contacted to be part of health research. If you are not contacted, this will be because researchers already have the mix of people they need. It will not be because of your personal or health information.</p>
  <p>If a researcher asks you to take part in their research, you do not have to say yes. It's your choice.</p>
  
  <h3>Contact from NHS Digital</h3>
  <p>If you gave permission for NHS Digital to contact you about research into coronavirus prevention and treatment, and other health conditions, they will contact you soon.</p>
