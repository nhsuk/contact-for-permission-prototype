  <p>Dear Joe Bloggs,</p>

  <p>Thank you, you've given your permission to be contacted for taking part in coronavirus vaccine research.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
  <p>Researchers will contact you if they think you may be suitable for a coronavirus clinical trial. Researchers may be from the NHS, or other places like drug companies or universities.</p>
  <p>There is no guarantee you will be contacted to be part of a clinical trial. You may not be contacted if researchers have enough of a particular mix of people, not be because of your personal or health information.</p>
  <p>If you gave permission, NHS Digital will also contact you about coronavirus prevention, treatment and other health research when more information is available.</p>
