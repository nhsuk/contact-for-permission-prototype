  <h1 class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Confirmation of withdrawing your permission</h1>

  <p>Dear Joe Bloggs,</p>

  <p>You've withdrawn your permission to be contacted for coronavirus vaccine research.</p>

  <p>Your details have been removed from the contact list, and your information deleted.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
  <p>You will no longer be contacted by any researchers about future coronavirus clinical trials.</p>
  <p>This does not remove you from any trials you are currently taking part in.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Giving your permission again</h2>
  <p>If you change your mind, you can <a href="/v4">give your permission again to be contacted about taking part in coronavirus vaccine research</a>.</p>
