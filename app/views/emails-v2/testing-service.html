  <p>Dear Joe Bloggs,</p>
  <p class="nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Birth date â€“ 15 March 1984</p>

  <p>Your coronavirus test result is negative. You did not have the virus when the test was done.</p>

  <p>You may return to work if you have not had a fever for 48 hours and feel well. Talk to your employer first.</p>

  <p>If you feel well but someone you live with tests positive, self-isolate for 14 days from when their symptoms started. If you get symptoms of coronavirus, self-isolate for 7 days.</p>

  <p>If you are shielding or you have been traced as a contact of someone who tested positive, or this is for a care home resident, follow the relevant guidelines. If the care home resident still has symptoms, they will need a medical assessment and may need a repeat test.</p>

  <p>If this result is for a child or staff member at school or nursery, tell the school or nursery.</p>

  <p>Contact 111 if you need medical help. In an emergency, dial 999.</p>
